I am a life science researcher, interested in invertebrate vision, scientific data analysis and scientific communication. I carried out my doctoral research on spatial vision in simple visual systems at Lund University, Sweden. I am a postdoc at Stazione Zoologica Anton Dohrn, Naples, working on photodetection in a sea urchin.
